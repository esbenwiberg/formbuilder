# Introduction 
# The Epic Formbuilder

The **formbuilder** is, as the name states, a builder of forms :)
It can **relieve** you from one of the more tiresome task of building forms thoughout your application.
It is **highly customizable** and can be tailored to your exact needs. As crazy as they may be.
Go through the supplied samples, to get inspired :)  

As for now it's a little hardwired to use FluentUI, but the plan is to extract that part to a different package
This will open up for people creating their own builders (it's simple AF) ie. a MaterialUI builder or any other you prefer
In the long run I might open up to other frameworks than React
